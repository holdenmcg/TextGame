You awake in a disorienting flash of light. Finding yourself sitting cross-legged on some sort of central pedestal, you stand and observe your 
surroundings, finding yourself in what seems to be a perfectly symmetrical room. The inward-outward pattern of the square outcroppings on the walls suggest a modernistic,
pragmatic perspective on design, and the entirety of the room is entirely stark white; studying yourself, you find that your blue-black suit represents the only thing
of color in the room. You begin to pace the perimeter of the room, finding four identical doors leading off into different directions. As you step closer to each door, they detect your
presence and open, and close as you stray farther from it. 

As you walk, you begin to study your suit, finding it to be some kind of pilot's apparel. It is tight against your skin, and strapped to its torso you find a firearm of some kind,
and your muscle memory guides you to unload from it a cell containing a frozen blue liquid, which you deduce to be its ammunition. You rechamber the cell and holster the firearm in a 
swift, likely practiced motion. 

There are several other devices on your person, but they seem to be in the form of small cubes and there doesn't seem to be a way to open them.

Although uncertain in your surroundings, your dexterity with the weapon lends you a kind of confidence. You resolve to choose a door to explore and discover more regarding your overall situation.
